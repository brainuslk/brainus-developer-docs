import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

## Overview

BrainUs AI is built specifically for developers who need reliable, citation-backed educational content. Unlike other solutions that use simple API proxies or manual PDF selection, BrainUs uses advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology to provide accurate, curriculum-aligned responses.

## Apilage AI

Apilage AI offers an API for educational chatbots, but with several limitations compared to BrainUs.

### Architecture Differences

**Apilage AI:** Uses direct Gemini API calls without true fine-tuning or RAG. Responses lack verifiable citations and curriculum alignment.

**BrainUs AI:** Purpose-built RAG system with 1000+ indexed curriculum documents. Every response includes verified citations with page numbers.

### Feature Comparison

| Feature                  | BrainUs AI                       | Apilage AI                 |

| **Citations**            | Yes, with page numbers           | No                         |
| **Token Pricing**        | 300 requests/month (Free)        | 150,000 tokens (60 days)   |
| **Validity**             | Monthly recurring                | 60 days expiry             |
| **Rate Limits**          | 10/min (Free), 60/min (Pro)      | Not documented             |
| **Documentation**        | Comprehensive with SDKs          | Basic cURL example         |
| **SDKs**                 | Python, JavaScript/TypeScript    | None                       |
| **Curriculum Alignment** | Verified Sri Lankan curriculum   | Generic responses          |
| **Language Support**     | Sinhala, English, Tamil          | Sinhala, English           |
| **Free Tier**            | Yes (300 requests)               | No                         |
| **Filters**              | Grade, subject, document filters | Not available              |
| **Response Quality**     | Citation-backed, verified        | Unverified LLM output      |

### Why Choose BrainUs?

**Better Architecture:** RAG ensures responses are grounded in actual curriculum documents, not generic LLM knowledge.

**Transparent Pricing:** Clear monthly limits with no token counting confusion. Free tier available.

**Developer Experience:** Official SDKs, comprehensive docs, code examples, and full API reference.

**Educational Focus:** Purpose-built for Sri Lankan curriculum with verified content sources.

<Callout type="info">
  Apilage AI's "150,000 tokens" translates to roughly 112,500 words or ~5,000
  requests. BrainUs Free tier offers 300 requests with predictable limits.
</Callout>

## Apola AI

Apola AI is a chat interface without a public API. Their approach requires manual grade/subject selection before each conversation.

### Architecture Differences

**Apola AI:** Uses a manual PDF selection mechanism. When you select grade/subject, it loads the relevant PDF and sends chunks with each query. No true AI-powered retrieval.

**BrainUs AI:** Intelligent RAG system that automatically retrieves relevant content across all documents without manual selection. Smart filtering and semantic search.

### Feature Comparison

| **Integration**           | Any application via API         | Web interface only             |
| **Scalability**           | Production-ready infrastructure | Limited to web UI              |
| **Batch Processing**      | Yes                             | No                             |
| **Rate Limits**           | Clear, documented limits        | Not applicable                 |

## Questions?

### "Why is BrainUs more expensive than Apilage AI's token model?"

BrainUs pricing is per-request, not per-token. This is more predictable and transparent. Our free tier (300 requests) is perfect for testing, and paid plans start at LKR 999/month for 2,000 requests.

### "Can I migrate from Apilage AI?"

Yes! Migration is straightforward. We provide migration guides and support. Contact [developers@brainus.lk](mailto:developers@brainus.lk).

### "Does BrainUs support custom content?"

Currently, BrainUs focuses on verified Sri Lankan curriculum content. Custom content integration is on our roadmap for Enterprise plans.

### "What makes RAG better than direct LLM calls?"

RAG grounds responses in actual documents, providing:

- Verifiable citations
- Reduced hallucinations
- Curriculum-accurate content
- Transparent sourcing

Direct LLM calls can hallucinate facts and provide unverified information.
