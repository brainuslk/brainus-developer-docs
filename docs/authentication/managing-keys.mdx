Learn how to create, manage, rotate, and revoke your API keys for secure access to the BrainUs API.

## Creating API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Navigate to Dashboard
    
    Go to [Dashboard → API Keys](https://developers.brainus.lk/dashboard/keys)
  </Step>

{" "}

<Step>### Generate New Key Click **"Generate New Key"** button</Step>

{" "}

<Step>
  ### Name Your Key Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production Server",
  "Development", "Staging")
</Step>

  <Step>
    ### Copy Immediately
    
    **Important:** Copy your key immediately - you won't be able to see it again!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Naming Best Practices

Use descriptive names that indicate:

- **Environment**: `prod-api-server`, `dev-local`, `staging-app`
- **Purpose**: `backend-api`, `mobile-app`, `data-pipeline`
- **Owner/Team**: `frontend-team`, `john-dev`, `analytics`

<Callout type="tip">
  Good naming makes it easier to identify which key to rotate or revoke when
  needed.
</Callout>

## Rotating API Keys

Regularly rotate your keys for security:

```bash
# 1. Generate a new key
NEW_KEY=$(brainus keys create --name "production-v2")

# 2. Update your application with new key
export BRAINUS_API_KEY=$NEW_KEY

# 3. Deploy and verify new key works
# 4. Revoke old key after successful deployment
brainus keys revoke key_old_abc123
```

### Rotation Schedule

| Environment | Recommended Frequency |
| ----------- | --------------------- |
| Production  | Every 90 days         |
| Staging     | Every 6 months        |
| Development | Yearly or as needed   |

## Revoking API Keys

Revoke keys immediately if:

- **Compromised**: Key was exposed publicly
- **Employee departure**: Team member leaves
- **No longer needed**: Deprecated project or service
- **Suspicious activity**: Unusual usage patterns detected

### How to Revoke

1. Go to [Dashboard → API Keys](https://developers.brainus.lk/dashboard/keys)
2. Find the key to revoke
3. Click **"Revoke"**
4. Confirm the action

<Callout type="warn">
  Revoking a key is **immediate and irreversible**. All requests using that key
  will fail instantly.
</Callout>

## Key Limits by Plan

| Plan       | Max API Keys |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Free       | 3            |
| Pro        | 10           |
| Enterprise | Unlimited    |

## Viewing Key Usage

Track which keys are being used:

```bash
# View usage per key
brainus usage --key-id key_abc123 --last 7d
```

In the dashboard, you can see:

- Last used timestamp
- Total requests made
- Current rate limit status
- Geographic usage patterns (Enterprise)

<Callout type="tip">
  Unused keys for 90+ days are flagged for review. Consider revoking them to
  reduce security risk.
