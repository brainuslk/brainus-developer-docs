The BrainUs API uses API keys to authenticate requests. API keys are unique identifiers that grant access to the API and track your usage against your plan limits.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Security First:** Treat your API keys like passwords. Never expose them in
  client-side code, public repositories, or share them publicly.
</Callout>

## Quick Example

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.brainus.lk/api/v1/query" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $BRAINUS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "What is photosynthesis?", "store_id": "default"}'
```

## Getting Your API Key

1. **Sign up** at [developers.brainus.lk](https://developers.brainus.lk)
2. Navigate to **Dashboard → API Keys**
3. Click **"Generate New Key"**
4. Copy your key immediately (you won't see it again!)
