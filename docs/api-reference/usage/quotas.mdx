Monitor your API quotas and understand your plan's limits to optimize usage and avoid service interruptions.

## Understanding Quotas

Your API plan includes multiple rate limits that work together:

| Limit Type           | Description                          | Reset Schedule          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Per-minute limit** | Maximum requests per minute          | Every 60 seconds        |
| **Daily limit**      | Maximum requests per 24-hour period  | Midnight UTC each day   |
| **Monthly quota**    | Total requests for the billing month | 1st of month, 00:00 UTC |

All limits must be satisfied for a request to succeed.

## Plan Limits

| Plan       | Per Minute | Per Day   | Monthly Quota |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------- | ------------- |
| Free       | 10         | 300       | 300           |
| Starter    | 20         | 10,000    | 10,000        |
| Pro        | 60         | 50,000    | 50,000        |
| Enterprise | 200        | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000     |

## Check Quota Status

Get your current quota usage programmatically:

### Python

```python
from brainus_ai import BrainusAI

async def check_quota():
    client = BrainusAI(api_key="your_api_key_here")
    usage = await client.get_usage()

    print(f"Plan: {usage.plan.name}")
    print(f"Quota used: {usage.quota_percentage:.1f}%")
    print(f"Remaining: {usage.quota_remaining:,} requests")
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { BrainusAI } from "@brainus/ai";

const client = new BrainusAI({ apiKey: "your_api_key_here" });
const usage = await client.getUsage();

console.log(`Plan: ${usage.plan.name}`);
console.log(`Quota used: ${usage.quotaPercentage.toFixed(1)}%`);
console.log(`Remaining: ${usage.quotaRemaining.toLocaleString()} requests`);
```

## Monitor Usage in Dashboard

For visual monitoring and detailed analytics, visit the **[Developer Dashboard](https://developers.brainus.lk/dashboard/usage)** where you can:

- View real-time quota usage with visual charts
- Track historical usage trends
- Set up quota alerts and notifications
- Analyze usage by endpoint and time period
- Monitor cost and token consumption
- Export usage data for reporting

## Quota Warnings

Watch for these response headers to monitor quota status:

```
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 45
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640000000
```

When you approach or exceed limits, you'll receive appropriate error responses:

- **429 Too Many Requests** - Rate limit exceeded
- **403 Forbidden** - Monthly quota exceeded

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor regularly** - Check quota status in the dashboard daily
2. **Set up alerts** - Configure notifications at 80% and 90% usage
3. **Plan ahead** - Upgrade before reaching limits during high-traffic periods
4. **Optimize usage** - Use caching and batch requests when possible
5. **Track trends** - Review historical data to predict future needs

## Upgrade Your Plan

If you're approaching your quota limits, consider upgrading your plan:

- **Starter** - For growing projects (10K/month)
- **Pro** - For production applications (50K/month)
- **Enterprise** - For large-scale deployments (1M/month)

Contact our [sales team](mailto:sales@brainus.lk) to discuss custom quotas for enterprise needs.
