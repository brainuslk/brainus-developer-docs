import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Analyze your API usage data to optimize costs, improve performance, and make informed decisions about your API consumption.

## Available Metrics

The Usage API provides key metrics for analyzing your consumption:

- **Request counts** - Total API calls made
- **Token usage** - Total tokens consumed
- **Cost tracking** - Total cost in USD
- **Endpoint breakdown** - Usage by endpoint
- **Time periods** - Usage over the billing period
- **Quota status** - Current quota utilization

## Quick Analysis

Get a snapshot of your usage programmatically:

### Python

```python
from brainus_ai import BrainusAI

async def analyze_usage():
    client = BrainusAI(api_key="your_api_key_here")
    usage = await client.get_usage()

    # Quick metrics
    print(f"Requests: {usage.total_requests:,}")
    print(f"Tokens: {usage.total_tokens:,}")
    print(f"Cost: ${usage.total_cost_usd:.4f}")
    print(f"Quota: {usage.quota_percentage:.1f}%")

    # Cost per request
    if usage.total_requests > 0:
        cost_per_request = usage.total_cost_usd / usage.total_requests
        print(f"Cost per request: ${cost_per_request:.6f}")
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
import { BrainusAI } from "@brainus/ai";

const client = new BrainusAI({ apiKey: "your_api_key_here" });
const usage = await client.getUsage();

// Quick metrics
console.log(`Requests: ${usage.totalRequests.toLocaleString()}`);
console.log(`Tokens: ${usage.totalTokens.toLocaleString()}`);
console.log(`Cost: $${usage.totalCostUsd.toFixed(4)}`);
console.log(`Quota: ${usage.quotaPercentage.toFixed(1)}%`);

// Cost per request
if (usage.totalRequests > 0) {
  const costPerRequest = usage.totalCostUsd / usage.totalRequests;
  console.log(`Cost per request: $${costPerRequest.toFixed(6)}`);
}
```

## Visual Analytics Dashboard

For comprehensive analytics and monitoring, use the **[Developer Dashboard](https://developers.brainus.lk/dashboard/usage)** which provides:

### Real-Time Monitoring

- Live usage graphs and charts
- Request rate visualization
- Token consumption trends
- Cost tracking over time

### Historical Analysis

- Daily, weekly, and monthly trends
- Endpoint usage comparison
- Cost projections and forecasting
- Peak usage identification

### Advanced Features

- **Custom date ranges** - Analyze any time period
- **Endpoint breakdown** - See which endpoints consume most quota
- **Export data** - Download usage data in CSV/JSON
- **Usage alerts** - Get notified of unusual patterns
- **Cost optimization** - Identify optimization opportunities

<Callout type="info">
  Access comprehensive usage analytics and monitoring tools at
  [developers.brainus.lk](https://developers.brainus.lk). The dashboard provides
  visual insights and detailed reports for your API usage.

## Key Metrics to Monitor

### 1. Cost Efficiency

Track your cost per request to identify optimization opportunities:

- Lower cost per request = better efficiency
- Compare across different endpoints
- Monitor trends over time

### 2. Token Usage

Understand token consumption patterns:

- Average tokens per request
- Token usage by endpoint
- Cost per 1K tokens

### 3. Quota Utilization

Monitor your quota usage to plan upgrades:

- Daily usage rate
- Month-to-date consumption
- Projected end-of-month usage

### 4. Endpoint Distribution

Analyze which endpoints are most used:

- Request count by endpoint
- Cost distribution across endpoints
- Performance patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Regular monitoring** - Review usage weekly in the dashboard
2. **Set up alerts** - Get notified of unusual patterns or quota thresholds
3. **Track trends** - Compare week-over-week and month-over-month
4. **Optimize costs** - Focus on high-cost, high-volume endpoints
5. **Plan capacity** - Use historical data to forecast future needs

## Programmatic Access

While the dashboard provides comprehensive visual analytics, you can also access usage data programmatically via the [Usage API](/docs/api-reference/usage) for:

- Custom integrations
- Automated reporting
- Alert systems
- Third-party analytics tools
