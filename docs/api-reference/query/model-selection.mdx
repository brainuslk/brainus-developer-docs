## Using Different Models

### Default Model

By default, your plan's first allowed model is used:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.brainus.lk/api/v1/dev/query \
  -H "X-API-Key: $BRAINUS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "store_id": "default"
  }'
```

This will use `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for Free/Starter/Pro plans, or `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` for Enterprise.

### Specify a Model (Enterprise Only)

Enterprise customers can specify which model to use:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.brainus.lk/api/v1/dev/query \
  -H "X-API-Key: $BRAINUS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "store_id": "default",
    "model": "gemini-2.5-flash"
  }'
```

**Valid values for your plan:**
- Free/Starter/Pro: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (only option)
- Enterprise: `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` or `gemini-2.5-flash`

<Callout type="warn">
  If you specify a model not available in your plan, the API will return a 403 error.
</Callout>
