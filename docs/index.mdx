## Quick Example

Here's a simple example of querying the BrainUs API:

<Tabs items={['curl', 'Python', 'JavaScript']}>
  <Tab value="curl">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.brainus.lk/api/v1/dev/query \
      -H "X-API-Key: $BRAINUS_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "query": "Explain photosynthesis",
        "store_id": "default"
      }'
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    import asyncio
    from brainus_ai import BrainusAI

    async def main():
        async with BrainusAI(api_key=os.getenv("BRAINUS_API_KEY")) as client:
            response = await client.query(
                query="Explain photosynthesis",
                store_id="default"
            )
            print(response.answer)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
